This document is just to try out the code in the book Python for Marketing Research and Analytics by Jason S. Schwarz. 
I find I remember things better when they are written down and I have a place to refer back to them. 
This is that place.

This is somewhere between a collection of notes and a place to try out what I'm learning. 
Think of it like a playground crossed with a notebook i guess.
